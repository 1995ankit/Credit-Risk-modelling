# Credit-Risk-modelling
### This code creates features on credit risk data using Weight of Evidence.

The workflow of the project is as follows:
####The project contains two jupyter notebook files - Feature_engineering.ipynb and PD_modelling.ipynb
  
#### The file 'Feature_engineering' uses existing variables to create new meaningful features.
##### Features with missing values are either removed, or the missing values are replaced with zero, mean, or maximum
##### Continous features are sub-divided into sub-features using coarse classfication.
##### Categorical features
